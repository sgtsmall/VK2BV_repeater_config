# VK2BV_repeater_config
Repeater configuration configs and scripts for Australian data

These scripts process local and Australian repeater Data

These scripts read data and create files that can be used in the various products own applications. 
ie they are usually imported within the individual radio setup program.

The ability to generate data files directly is coming along slowly, basically integrating with chirp where practical
